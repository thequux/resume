\section{Employment Experience}
\cventry{2010--2011}{Site Reliability Engineer}{Google, Inc.}{Mountain View, CA}{}{
  Worked with a team of eight people to run a low-latency, highly
  available planet-scale storage system for petabytes of data.
  Debugged production issues including fiber cuts, misbehaving
  clients, heavy resource contention, and hardware failure.
  Participated in weekly on-call rotation, with an SLA requiring a
  five-minute response time.  Helped internal clients get started
  using our service.  Led project to automate deployment of new
  versions of our service across dozens of clusters; reduced SRE time
  spent on weekly pushes by 90\%.  Supported Cellbots project in 20\%
  time.  Assisted with design of the ``IOIO'' I/O board for Android.}

\cventry{2009--2010}{Co-founder}{Flippity.com}{Los Angeles, CA}{}{
  Wrote and optimized backend for Craigslist and eBay search site
  using Python and PostgreSQL.  Wrote core of distributed scraping
  tool using a Java applet with a Python server component.
  Implemented the use of Gerrit for code reviews.}
  
\cventry{2009}{System Administrator}{Law Firm of Moreno, Becerra, and Casillas}{Los Angeles, CA}{}{
  Maintenance and operation of a network of two Windows servers
  serving twenty Windows clients as sole systems administrator, with
  responsibility for all network services, including Exchange and
  Active Directory.  Resolved various systems issues such as Android
  clients being unable to fetch email; implemented Postini email
  filtering.}

\cventry{2008}{Systems Administration Intern}{Google, Inc.}{Santa Monica, CA}{}{
  Debugged workaround in kernel for NFS group count limitation using
  KDB. Helped develop on-disk format for the TUX3 fourth- generation
  Linux file system.  Suggested and investigated switching to GIT for
  internal version-control.  Debugged Kerberos/LDAP integration on
  Google's corporate WAN.}

\cventry{2007--2008}{Laboratory Assistant III}{Network Research Lab, University of California}{Los Angeles, CA}{Network Research Laboratory}{
  Wrote kernel-mode drivers for specialized video coding hardware on a
  custom ST40-based board running embedded Linux for an
  industry-funded project seeking to develop a peer-to-peer streaming
  video system similar to BitTorrent.}

\cventry{2006--2007}{Intern}{Northrop Grumman Corporation, Space \& Technology Sector}{Los Angeles, CA}{}{
  Worked on design and implementation of a reliability calculation
  software package for internal use.  Wrote tool to allow remote
  dialing of Cisco VOIP telephones from Microsoft Outlook 2003.
  Compared derating and Digital IC/Hybrid part specifications.}


\section{Personal Projects}

\cventry{2010--Present}{Co-developer of GoodFET}{}{}{}{
  Implemented Atmel AVR target support.  Added support for certain
  subfamilies of Microchip PIC24F chips.  Designed and evaluated new
  board design based on TI Stellaris LM3S3739 microprocessor.
  Designed new board variant based on TI MSP430F5510 microcontroller;
  reduced cost by 50\% and component count by 10\%.}

\cventry{2007--2010}{System Administrator for UCLA Linux Users' Group}{}{}{}{
  Administered two servers for the UCLA LUG, with responsibility for
  email, web, shell, network authentication, server configuration, and
  administration procedures.  Implemented Kerberos authentication.
  Initiated documentation of system design and operating procedures.}

\cventry{Fall 2008}{Tutorials for UCLA CS152B -- Digital Logic Design Lab}{}{}{}{
  Created a pair of tutorials for developing hardware systems on the
  Digilent XUPV2P Virtex 2 Pro evaluation board, covering interfacing
  custom hardware with the built-in PowerPC 405 processor cores and
  interfacing with the onboard AC'97 audio codec.  These tutorials are
  currently used by the UCLA Computer Science Department as course
  instruction materials.}

\cventry{Fall 2008}{Postscript extensions for programming use}{}{}{}{
  Used PostScript reflection to add several higher-order functions to
  the language, including function currying, composition, Factor-style
  \texttt{cleave}, \texttt{keep}, and \texttt{bi} operators.  Also
  developed sample unit testing framework.  Presented demo as a
  technical talk to the Southern California Functional Programmers
  group in November, 2008.}
